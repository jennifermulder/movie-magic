## Purpose
To create an application that provides a "Search and Save" for various movies using OMDB API utilizing an Appolo server and GraphQL in lieu of RESTful APIs.

## Features

When the user signs up or logs in to their profile, they are able to add the movies that they have searched to a nomination list. They can also remove any movies that they no longer think should be nominated.
